Most of the enterprises, these days, are devising their products and services in a customer centric way. In coming years, most of the companies are expected to shift from a product focused view of the world to a customer focused one. Hence, for long-term profitability and viability of any enterprise in any domain, the customer experience and satisfaction is utmost important. In an era of digital disruption, AI-ML methodologies can be combined with customer databases to build a robust Customer relationship management (CRM) system. A CRM system is very useful to the Mechanical Engineering domain for the purpose of product lifecycle management as well as enhancing customer experience. This Work summarizes the development of such a next generation customer relationship management tool using machine learning methodologies and deploying the tool as a web interface for real time usage. A CRM system is applicable in almost all the domains, but for this project, the context of Online Retail Industry is considered. The tool developed is based on the data and context of a UK-based and registered non-store business. Data science techniques and machine learning algorithms are used to develop the model. Various key performance indicators like RFM, CLTV, etc., predictive techniques for customer segmentation, sales forecasting, etc. and customer relation parameters are inhibited in the tool. As a result, a web interface tool called GRAHAK360 is deployed for real time analysis and usage by any third party industry person using a suitable deployment platform. The tool created as a part of this project surely has a large scope of extension.
