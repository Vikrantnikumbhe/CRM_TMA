Most of the enterprises, these days, are devising their products and services in a customer centric way. In coming years, most of the companies are expected to shift from a product focused view of the world to a customer focused one. Hence, for long-term profitability and viability of any enterprise in any domain, the customer experience and satisfaction is utmost important. In an era of digital disruption, AI-ML methodologies can be combined with customer databases to build a robust Customer relationship management (CRM) system. A CRM system is very useful to the Mechanical Engineering domain for the purpose of product lifecycle management as well as enhancing customer experience. This Work summarizes the development of such a next generation customer relationship management tool using machine learning methodologies and deploying the tool as a web interface for real time usage. A CRM system is applicable in almost all the domains, but for this project, the context of Online Retail Industry is considered. The tool developed is based on the data and context of a UK-based and registered non-store business. Data science techniques and machine learning algorithms are used to develop the model. Various key performance indicators like RFM, CLTV, etc., predictive techniques for customer segmentation, sales forecasting, etc. and customer relation parameters are inhibited in the tool. As a result, a web interface tool called GRAHAK360 is deployed for real time analysis and usage by any third party industry person using a suitable deployment platform. The tool created as a part of this project surely has a large scope of extension.

## Activities that can be Performed:

-[To predict expected future transactions to be performed by a customer in a given time period.]

-[To predict a company's net profit contribution to its overall future relationship with a customer.]

-[To segment customers based on RFM modeling technique.]

-[To segment customers based on Hybrid (K-means with RFM) modeling technique.]

-[To create association rules for product recommendations using Market-Basket Analysis.]

-[To create a classifier that will classify the customers into various categories.]

-[To analyze and validate different classifiers and to select the right classifier based on their predicting ability and quality of fit.]

-[To forecast the future sales using the historic sales patterns in the dataset.]

-[To analyze the forensic aspects of a dataset like churn rate using different visual plots and key metrics.]

-[To analyze the retention analytics over time by computing monthly and cohort based retention rates.]
